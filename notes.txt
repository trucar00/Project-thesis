Done: Data preprocessing, cleaned out outliers, removed points where vessel is stationary (harbor), extracted trajectories for the same vessel.
Dropped all vessels with rare messages, both not often enough and too few instances (too short trips). Downsampled to 30s interval, with linear interpolation


May need to enlarge the sample space to capture also large fishing vessels far out at sea. Fex vessels fishing around bjørnøya.

From the resampled datasets, create a training dataframe. Speed, COG, ROT, LAT, LON. Divide trajectories into 1h / 2h chunks (what is a reasonable time?).
Autoencoder needs to be trained on same size time intervals.

Plot all the trajectories first and last point to see if any ships are far north. 

Nice trajectories:
